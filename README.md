# MASM x86 Algorithms — Coursework

This repository contains my assembly-language exercises written for the "Computer Systems Architecture" course (at University). These are my student work and experiments in MASM/x86 — I worked hard on them and, in the end, I passed :D.

## Contents

- Assembly source files (.asm)
- Short notes in comments inside each source file explaining the approach

## Notes and disclaimers

- These files were created as part of coursework; they are educational and often intentionally low-level and verbose for clarity.
- If you use or adapt any code, please keep the original author attribution.
